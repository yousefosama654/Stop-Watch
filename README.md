# Stop-Watch
this is a project of ATmega32 AVR architecture, It's a stopwatch consisting of seconds, minutes, and hours. it counts till one day and overflows again to zero. I used the Timer1 16-bit timer on compare mode to detect the second and increment time. There are also three push buttons to reset, pause, and resume using external interrupts  with pull-up and pull-down resistors design.
